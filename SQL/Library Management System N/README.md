## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/pawarprajwal21/Data-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Library%20Management%20System%20N/ER-modal.png)

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)
);


-- Create table "Employee"

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql

insert into books (isdn,book_title,category, rental_price,statu,author,publisher)
values('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
select * from books;

```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
update members 
set member_address='125 Main St'
where member_id='C101';
select * from members;

```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
delete from issued_status
where issued_id = 'IS121';
select * from issued_status;
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql

select * from issued_status
where issued_emp_id='E101';

```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
select issued_emp_id, 
count(issued_id) as total_book_issued
from issued_status
group by issued_emp_id
having count(issued_id)>1;

```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
create table book_cnts
select b.isbn,b.book_title, count(ist.issued_id) as no_issued
from books as b
join issued_status as ist
on ist.issued_book_isbn=b.isbn
group by 1,2;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
 
 select * from books
where Category='Classic';

```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql

select 
b.Category, sum(b.rental_price),count(*)
from books as b
join issued_status as ist
on ist.issued_book_isbn=b.isbn
group by 1;

```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
select * from members
where reg_date>= current_date-interval 180 day;

```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql

select e1.*,
b.manager_id,
e2.emp_name as manager
from employees as e1
join
branch as b
on b.branch_id=e1.branch_id
join
employees as e2
on b.manager_id=e2.emp_id;
-- Task 11. Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold 7USD:
create table book_price_greater_than_seven
as
select * from books
where rental_price>7;

select * from book_price_greater_than_seven;
-- Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned
select 
distinct ist.issued_book_name
from issued_status as ist
left join return_status as rs
on ist.issued_id = rs.issued_id
where rs.return_id is null;

select * from return_status;

```
## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 11: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql

SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, ist.issued_date) AS over_dues_days
FROM
    issued_status AS ist
        JOIN
    members AS m ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
        JOIN
    books AS bk ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
        LEFT JOIN
    return_status AS rs ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE
    rs.return_date IS NULL
        AND DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1;

```


**Task 12: Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).


```sql

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    issued_status
WHERE
    issued_book_isbn = '978-0-330-25864-8';
-- IS104

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    books
WHERE
    isbn = '978-0-451-52994-2';

UPDATE books 
SET 
    status = 'no'
WHERE
    isbn = '978-0-451-52994-2';

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    return_status
WHERE
    issued_id = 'IS130';

-- 
INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
VALUES
('RS125', 'IS130', CURRENT_DATE, 'Good');
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    return_status
WHERE
    issued_id = 'IS130';
DELIMITER $$

    IN p_return_id VARCHAR(10), 
    IN p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), 
    IN p_book_quality VARCHAR(10)
)
BEGIN

    DECLARE v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
    DECLARE v_book_name VARCHAR(80);
    DECLARE v_count INT;

    -- Check already returned
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count
    FROM return_status
    WHERE issued_id = p_issued_id;

    IF v_count > 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Book already returned!';
    END IF;

    -- Get book details
    SELECT issued_book_isbn, issued_book_name
    INTO v_isbn, v_book_name
    FROM issued_status
    WHERE issued_id = p_issued_id
    LIMIT 1;

    IF v_isbn IS NULL THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Invalid issued_id!';
    END IF;

    -- Insert return record
    INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
    VALUES (p_return_id, p_issued_id, CURDATE(), p_book_quality);

    -- Update book status 
    UPDATE books
    SET status = 'yes'
    WHERE isbn = v_isbn;

    -- Optional message
    SELECT CONCAT('Thank you for returning the book: ', v_book_name) AS message;

**Task 13: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    branch;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    issued_status;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    employees;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    books;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    return_status;

CREATE TABLE branch_reports AS SELECT b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) AS number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) AS total_revenue FROM
    issued_status AS ist
        JOIN
    employees AS e ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
        JOIN
    branch AS b ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
        LEFT JOIN
    return_status AS rs ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
        JOIN
    books AS bk ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1 , 2;
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    branch_reports;
```

**Task 14: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql
CREATE TABLE active_members AS SELECT * FROM
    members
WHERE
    member_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT
            issued_member_id
        FROM
            issued_status
        WHERE
            issued_date > CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 2 MONTH);

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    active_members;


```


**Task 15: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql

SELECT 
    e.emp_name, b.*, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_book_issued
FROM
    issued_status AS ist
        JOIN
    employees AS e ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
        JOIN
    branch AS b ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1 , 2;
```


**Task 16: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE issued_book(
    IN p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),
    IN p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(10),
    IN p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
)
BEGIN

    DECLARE v_status VARCHAR(10);

    -- Check book availability
    SELECT status
    INTO v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    -- If book available
    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        INSERT INTO issued_status(
            issued_id,
            issued_member_id,
            issued_date,
            issued_book_isbn,
            issued_emp_id
        )
        VALUES(
            p_issued_id,
            p_issued_member_id,
            CURDATE(),
            p_issued_book_isbn,
            p_issued_emp_id
        );

        UPDATE books
        SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        SELECT CONCAT(' Book issued successfully: ', p_issued_book_isbn) AS message;

    ELSE
        SELECT CONCAT(' Book not available: ', p_issued_book_isbn) AS message;
    END IF;

END$$

DELIMITER ;
CALL issued_book('IS200', 'C101', '978-0-330-25864-8', 'E104');


```
